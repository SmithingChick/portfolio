The place where I come from is a small town. They think so small, They use small words. But not me! I\'m smarter than that! I worked it out. I\'ve been stretching my mouth To let those big words come right out. I\'ve had enough, I\'m getting out To the city, the big big city. I\'ll be a big noise with all the big boys. There\'s so much stuff I will own And I will pray to a big god as I kneel in the big church. I\'m going to watch it growing. Big time! My parties all have big names And I greet them with the widest smile, Tell them how my life is one big adventure. And always they\'re amazed When I show them \'round my house, to my bed. I had it made like a mountain range With a snow-white pillow for my big fat head. And my heaven will be a big heaven And I will walk through the front door. Big time! I\'m on my way-I\'m making it. Big time! I\'ve got to make it show-yeah! So much larger than life. I\'m going to watch it growing. Big time! My car is getting bigger. My house is getting bigger. My eyes are getting bigger And my mouth. My belly is getting bigger And my bank account. Look at my circumstance And the bulge in my big big big big big big big</p>'

Could it be he\'s taking over me? I\'m dancing barefoot, Headin\' for a spin. Some strange music draws me in. It makes me come up like some heroine. She is sublimation, She is the essence of thee. She is concentrating on He who is chosen by she. Here I go and I don\'t know why I spin so ceaselessly. Could it be he\'s taking over me? I\'m dancing barefoot, Headin\' for a spin. Some strange music draws me in. It makes me come up like some heroine. She is recreation, She intoxicated by thee. She has the slow sensation that He is levitating with she. Here I go and I don\'t know why I spin so ceaselessly. \'Til I lose my sense of gravity I\'m dancing barefoot, Headin\' for a spin. Some strange music draws me in. It makes me come up like some heroine. Oh God, I fell for you.</p>'

And I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule And I made me a ladder from a pawn shop marimba. I leaned it all up against a dandelion tree. Gonna whittle you into kindlin\'. Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six. Now I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed And I tore out the buckets from a red corvette. Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three. Meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree With the strings of a Washburn like a clothes line. Now me and that mule scrambled right through the hole. Gonna take a 38 hours long gone train I just Long gone train Just long gone train I just long Long</p>'

Mama\'s gone crazy \'cause her baby\'s cut down By some teenage car chase, war out of bounds. It was the wrong place, wrong time, wrong end of a gun. Sad. Shoot! Shoot straight! From the hip, ya\'ll. Gone forever in a trigger slip, Well, it could have been, It could have been your brother. Shoot to kill, yeah. Blame each other, well, blame yourself. You know, God is a bullet. Have mercy on us everyone. They\'re gonna call me sir, they\'ll all stop picking on me. Well, I\'m a high school grad, I\'m over five-foot-three. I\'ll get a badge and a gun and I\'ll join the P.D. They\'ll see. He didn\'t have to use the gun they put in his hand But when the guy came at him, well, he panicked and ran And it\'s a thirty long years \'fore they\'ll give him another chance. And it\'s sad, sad, yes, sad. Shoot! Shoot straight From the hip, ya\'ll. It\'s all gone in a trigger slip. Well, it could have been your mother. Shoot to kill, ya\'ll. Blame each other, blame yourself. You know, God is a bullet, Have mercy on us everyone. Shoot! John Lennon Shoot! Dr. King, yeah, Harvey Milk, and all for goddamn nothing! God is a bullet, Have mercy on us everyone.</p>'

I began to warm and chill To objects and their fields, A ragged cup, a twisted mop, The face of Jesus in my soup, Those sinister dinner deals The meal trolley\'s wicked wheels A hooked bone rising from my food All things either good or ungood. And the mercy seat is waiting And I think my head is burning And in a way I\'m yearning To be done with all this measuring of proof. An eye for an eyeA tooth for a tooth And anyway I told the truth And I\'m not afraid to die. Interpret signs and catalogue A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog. The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind. They are sick breath gathering at my hind. I hear stories from the chamber How Christ was born into a manger And like some ragged stranger Died upon the cross And might I say, it seems so fitting in its way He was a carpenter by trade Or at least that\'s what I\'m told. Like my good hand tattooed E.V.I.L. across it\'s brother\'s fist That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist. In Heaven His throne is made of gold The ark of his Testament is stowed A throne from which I\'m told All history does unfold. Down here it\'s made of wood and wire And my body is on fire And God is never far away. Into the mercy seat I climb My head is shaved, my head is wired And like a moth that tries To enter the bright eye So I go shuffling out of life Just to hide in death awhile And anyway I never lied. My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L. Wears a wedding band that\'s G.O.O.D. \'Tis a long-suffering shackle Collaring all that devil blood. And the mercy seat is a-burning And I think my head is flowing And in a way I\'m hoping To be done with all this weighing up of truth. An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And I\'ve got nothing left to lose And I\'m not afraid to die. And anyway, there was no proof And nor a motive why.  Now the mercy seat is waiting And I think my head is smoking And in a way I\'m hoping To be done with all these looks of disbelief. A eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And anyway I told the truth And I\'m not afraid to die. And the mercy seat is waiting And I think my head is burning And in a way I\'m yearning To be done with all this measuring of proof An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And anyway I told the truth But I\'m afraid I told a lie.</p>'

I\'ll be sitting in your mirror Now is the place where the crossroads meet Will you look into the future? Never, never say goodbye To my part of your life No, no, no, no, no! Let me live!" She said, "C\'mon and let me live, girl! This moment in time,It doesn\'t belong to you, It belongs to me And to your little boy and to your little girl And the one hand clapping: Where on your palm is my little line When you\'re written in mine As an old memory? Never, never say goodbye To my part of your life Oh no, no, no, no, no! Never, never let me go!" I put this moment.....here. I put this moment.....here. I put this moment-- "Over here! "Over here! Can\'t you see where memories are kept bright? Tripping on the water like a laughing girl Time in her eyes is spawning past lifeOne with the ocean and the woman unfurled Holding all the love that waits for you here Catch us now for I am your future A kiss on the wind and we\'ll make the land. Come over here to where When lingers Waiting in this empty world. Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools We are of the going water and the gone We are of water in the holy land of water And all that\'s to come runs in With the thrust on the strand."<p>'
